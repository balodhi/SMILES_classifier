# SMILES_classifier
Toxicity Classifier based of molecules based their SMILES representation

This project was an assignment given by CSCI3230 'Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence' at the Chinese university of Hong Kong.

The aim of the project was to use TensorFlow to classify molecules based on their SMILES representation.
Different architecture of neural networks where used to achieve a high as possible balanced accuracy.
